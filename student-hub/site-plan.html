      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>This site is intended to be a hub of activity for the students that I will teach in my language classrooms. This site will provide information to enable both students and parents to contact me, allow students access to resources needed for classes, and provide additional (non-required) learning resources for students.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>The audience for my site will be both students, parents of students, and alumni from classes that I have taught. The main audience will be students, and therefore will be geared towards both teenagers and young adults, but will still be accessible to parents.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Welcome to our world language resource hub, a unique blend of traditional learning methods and modern educational insights. As we step into an era where global connectivity matters more than ever, understanding a language goes beyond its words; it's about embracing cultures, histories, and perspectives. Here, we provide resources that not only sharpen linguistic skills but also open doors to global cultures. As Nelson Mandela once said, â€œIf you talk to a man in a language he understands, that goes to his head. If you talk to him in his own language, that goes to his heart."
      </p>
      <p>
        This platform is tailored for both eager students and supportive parents. With a vast repository of resources, interactive tools, and curated content, we aim to make the language learning journey comprehensive and engaging. Dive in and explore the rich tapestry of world languages, discover fascinating cultural tidbits, and empower your linguistic journey.

        Hello, I'm Jordan Ellington. Over the past decade, I've dedicated myself to the world of language education, nurturing young minds and fostering a love for linguistics. My journey began at Brigham Young University - Idaho, where I not only am acquiring my academic credentials but also am developing a vision: to transform language learning into an experience that's vibrant, engaging, and deeply rooted in cultural contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, languages are not just sets of rules and vocabulary. They are living, breathing entities that capture the essence of diverse human experiences. My experiences in various countries have enriched my understanding, allowing me to dive deep into the heartbeats of various cultures. These journeys have added layers to my teaching methodology, ensuring that each lesson is not just about the 'how' but also the 'why' behind every linguistic nuance. I have a wide variety of passions, including but not limited to music, learning, stories, games, and my dog named Prince. When I'm not teaching, you'll find me immersed in a book, exploring a new travel destination, or enjoying melodies from around the world. This platform is a culmination of my passion, experience, and the desire to make the world of languages accessible to all.

Whether you're here to understand curriculum nuances, seek resources to bolster learning at home, or simply immerse in the fascinating world of languages your child is exploring, you're in the right place.
