        Hello all, nice to meet you. I am in my last semester of classes,
        and I am excited to graduate. I was originally a Software Engineering major,
        but I switched over to Spanish Education, and will be graduating with a Bachelors of Arts.

        I am originally from Ohio, but I came out here to school in April of 2021, where I met my 
        lovely wife Rachel. We have a dog named prince, and he's just a little goober. We still live 
        in Rexburg, but we'll be moving once my wife graduates.

        My favorite thing about coding is that whenever there is an issue or goal, in theory there should
        always be a way to fix the issue. Very logical (kind of like me).
